        <p>If you‚Äôve been on a cruise in the last few years, you might have noticed some stowaways: little rubber ducks nestled in plants, on banisters and doorframes, and peeking out from hard-to-reach spots in elevators and bathrooms.

 The whimsical bath toys are popping up all over the place on cruise ships thanks to a massive, unofficial game of hide-and-seek‚Ä¶ and everyone is invited.</p>

            <p>This tradition, which is especially popular with multigenerational groups, has become a beloved side quest for cruisers of all ages. And for the more than 275,000 members of the Cruising Ducks Facebook group, who often refer to themselves as ‚Äúquackers,‚Äù it‚Äôs much more than a fad. It‚Äôs a fun and easy way to spread a little joy and create community on the high seas. </p>
